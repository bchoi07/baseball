# Baseball HR Analysis

The purpose of this analysis was to create a logistic regression model for baseball hit data from the 2020 MLB season to determine whether a hit was a home run. The model was then used to find the "best" predictor variables for a home run. 

Data and inspiration comes from https://www.kaggle.com/jcraggy/baseball.

## Analysis Results
From training the model, we find that the best predictors for whether a hit is a home run or not is launch angle, launch speed, launch_angle, and the type of hit (specifically if it is a ground ball or fly ball).
